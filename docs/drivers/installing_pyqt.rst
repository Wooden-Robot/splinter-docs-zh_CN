In order to use Spynner driver, you need to install PyQt4. PyQt4 has a few dependencies,
follow the steps below to get PyQt4 and its dependencies running on your system.

Install Qt4

The biggest and most important PyQt4 dependency is the Qt4 itself.
You can download it from its `official website <http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/>`_ and
install with a nice and friendly wizard.

Install SIP

Another PyQt4 dependency is `SIP <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/intro>`_, which
is a tool used to create Python bindings for C and C++ libraries. You can navigate to the
`download page on SIP website <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/download>`_,
choose the version according to your operating system, extract the download package and
install it using three commands:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ tar -xvzf sip-4.xx.x.tar.gz
    $ cd sip-4.xx.x
    $ python configure.py
    $ make
    $ [sudo] make install

Now we can finally install PyQt4. Go to the `PyQt4 download page <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download>`_
and download the PyQt4 version according to your platform. After these steps, all you need to do is extract the download
